I have no idea how many times I have written this kind of article. You know, the kind where I tell you how I decided to redo my website, change the layout, rebuild it from used tissues&#8230;. that kind of article. Well, this is another one. Why, when I have only recently finished <a href="http://www.krautsourced.com">Krautsourced.com</a>, am I opening up another website, on a different domain too? It&#8217;s because I was tired of mixing and matching my professional portfolio with some half arsed attempt at creating a blog, making sacrifices to the portfolio&#8217;s layout, so it can acommodate for blog articles as well &#8211; only to get fed up with all of it time and again. Also, I doubt many of those looking for me as a freelancer are interested in my random musings or code snippets. So instead, this. A new site. I tried Joomla first, but for a site this small it was overkill. Then I tried Zotonic, which is Erlang based and seemed very cool and fast. Unfortunately it did not play well with Webfaction. So in the end, it was back to WordPress and the Bones HTML5 bootstrap theme.

So what is the Flip Switching Monkey all about? It&#8217;s from a scene of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120738/">Lost in Space</a> remake (judging from the IMDB rating, you may not have seen it), where Matt LeBlanc&#8217;s only job as the highly trained pilot is to flip a switch to start the space ship. Thus &#8220;And the monkey flips the switch.&#8221; and off it goes. Someone put the scene on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NId8x0GyC4">Youtube</a> (and managed to cut it in a way that makes it as unfunny as possible&#8230;). I think Lost in Space was my very first DVD, back in the day when they just came out, so I&#8217;m a bit nostalgic about it (and I&#8217;ve not watched it for probably 10 years now, so it may well have been shit.) One thing I DO remember is that during the launch of the spaceship my subwoofer almost gave up the ghost, so if nothing else, there was some decent low level bass in there.

Right, what will I post here? The idea is to move all the creative coding related stuff, or coding in general, here. I&#8217;ll try to stay clear of rants, politics and aliens, though every now and then they&#8217;ll come together in way that requires venting of opinions on the internets. There&#8217;ll also be stuff about 3D and Visual Effects, though mostly from a technical standpoint. No film reviews and such.
  
I&#8217;ll go flip some more switches now. Over and out.
