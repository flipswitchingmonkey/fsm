Nothing throws me off more when working with multiple application than different shortcuts and mouse controls. It&#8217;s just super annoying to constantly having to readjust and actively think about how your hands are moving, instead of concentrating on the actual task at hand.

Having just started looking into the Unreal 4 engine, this was the first thing that immediately put me off a bit &#8211; the middle mouse navigation (Pan) acts inverse to how one is used to from other 3D apps. Remember the first days when Apple changed the default touchscreen scroll direction? Yeah. Like that. Only in more dimensions.

Luckily &#8211; and I admit, this barely even qualifies as a &#8220;quicktip&#8221; &#8211; there is an option in the preferences that lets you invert the inverted, and since minus times minus makes plus, we&#8217;re golden.
