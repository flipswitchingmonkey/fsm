Yes, that&#8217;s right. Fusion 7.5, which was just recently bought by Blackmagic from Eyeon (or rather Eyeon itself was bought, iirc), has now [been released](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion). And the standard version, just like previously done with Resolve, is now available for free. Plus, the way I understand it, the free version uses the same project files as the $999 version, so they are going to be interchangeable! That is huge! Also, the $999 version will not require any subscription or online connection or anything. It&#8217;s just a good old licence. Go download it now! It really is very powerful and, especially at this price point, will mean stiff competition for Nuke.
