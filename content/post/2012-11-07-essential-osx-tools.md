I&#8217;m using both OSX and Windows at the same time, so my workflow is slightly &#8220;tainted&#8221; by both of them. I hate having to readjust every time I switch workstations, so I&#8217;m trying to set everything up as similar as possible. There are a few things I like about each system, and oftentimes there are tools available to implement that feature on the other OS. This is a list of tools I install on every OSX.

  * [BetterTouchTool][1] – additional configuration options for the multitouch pad, as well as advanced window management. You get one of the best features of Win 7, dragging a window to the sides to scale it to full or half screen size. Also you can use your multitouch for more advanced commands. For example I’m using a three finger drag to show all open apps via Expose.
  * [Alfred][2] – quick launcher, clipboard manager, search bar&#8230; you name it. Has totally replaced spotlight and any other clipboard manager for me.
  * [gfxCardStatus][3] – very handy for the new MacBookPros, lets you easily switch between the Intel and AMD chipsets, as well as force one or the other during startup.
  * [KeyMap4MacBook][4] – remap your keyboard to whatever you want. I for example am using a UK layout for programming (seriously, the German layout on a mac is fucked up), but Apple isn’t using the same UK layout as Microsoft. Because I’m constantly jumping between Mac and PC, it’s annoying to constantly hit the wrong key. So in my case I’ve put the @ where you’d find it on a PC keyboard.
  * [HandsOff][5] / [Little Snitch][6] – software firewalls that block app access to the network as well as file system (in the case of HandsOff). They are basically the same (it looks like HandsOff was originally heavily “inspired” by Little Snitch) but now HandsOff is offering a few more features at less money. So that’s the one I bought.
  * [Dropbox][7] – of course
  * [MenuMeters][8] – great system status tool for the menu bar
  * [Mouse Acceleration Preference Pane][9] – using an external mouse with osx is a horrific experience. There’s something entirely off about the speed curves. This fixes it.
  * [Growl][10] – essential tool for app and system notification popups
  * [MplayerX][11] – my media player of choice. Cleaner interface than VLC (in my opinion). Still not a KMPlayer replacement…
  * [Forklift 2][12] – File manager similar to Total Commander. Not quite the same, but the best on OSX, if you want a similar experience. Other file managers like [Pathfinder][13] are equally powerful but follow more of a Finder approach, so if you prefer that then Pathfinder may be better for you. I prefer Forklift by a long margin.
  * [Sublime Text 2][14] – Hands down the best editor there is. And it&#8217;s multi platform. Just perfect.
  * [Burn][15] – cd burning app. Straight forward and works great.
  * [Bartender][16] &#8211; a small app that cleans up the status bar and collects all those icons, similar to how Windows does it in the taskbar.
  * [Adium][17] &#8211; my instant messenger of choice. Supports all kinds of protocols, incl. IRC, and is quick. Even integrates with Skype (although Skype still needs to run in the background).
  * [Klok2][18] &#8211; time keeping app, easy to use, nice interface, Adobe AIR based, so it&#8217;s multi-platform.
  * [Totals][19] &#8211; Billing app. Good template editor and relatively easy to use. Definitely better than dealing with Excel-sheets&#8230;

I’m of course using a lot of other apps for work, but these are the more general ones that really improved my OSX experience. Some of them fix or add features in OSX that I just can’t understand how they could have been overlooked by Apple.

All of these work with Mountain Lion.
