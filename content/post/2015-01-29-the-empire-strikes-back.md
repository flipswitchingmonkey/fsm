Here&#8217;s what I wrote previously under &#8220;Episode whatever &#8211; a new hope&#8221;:

> With this rather witty title (well&#8230;) I shall once again endeavour to, you guessed it, blog. Yes, please do, I hear you (nay millions of voices suddenly!) cry out, it has worked out so well in the past! I shall obey, of course.
> 
> Which brings us to this blank slate of a blog (yes, there were old posts which may or may not eventually reappear, if there is a demand for it). It is now not using WordPress, but instead runs on [Ghost](https://ghost.org), a new node.js based blogging system that as the name suggests, focuses on blogging. So, not so much a CMS. The initial impression is quite positive, a very nice editor with realtime preview and otherwise very basic (read: reduced to the essential) interface. I like it. Very clean. Let&#8217;s wait for the inevitable installation of a few hundred plugins&#8230;

> Please note the image on the left. I rather like it. Done with the new reflectance shader in Cinema 4D as of R16. Which shall be the topic of my first real post. Which I could have written days ago, if I had not instead started fiddling with the website and aforementioned Ghost. But there you go. Nerds, eh?

Aaaaaand we&#8217;re back. To WordPress. Because, if I&#8217;m honest, the main thing convincing me to use Ghost was its nice, clean editor. Everything else was very, very limited. And then along came [Gust](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gust/), which implements just this editor for WordPress. Best of both worlds? We&#8217;ll see.
