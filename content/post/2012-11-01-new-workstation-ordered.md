Since I got fed up with having to heat up my current workstation every morning (I&#8217;m not joking, there&#8217;s some sort of hardware issue that requires the system to reach a core temp of over 65 deg in the BIOS before stable operation is possible &#8211; so much fun!), and there&#8217;s a lot of shiny new hardware out there, I went and ordered a new workstation. Some benchmarks will follow (unless I&#8217;m drowningin my own tears when it turns out the componentes don&#8217;t like each other&#8230;), for now this is the shopping list:

  * CPU: Intel i7 3930K
  * Mainboard: ASUS P9X79 WS
  * Cooler: Noctua NH-D14 + mounting kit for socket 2011
  * Power: NZXT Hale Power 90+
  * Case: anidees AI-6BS Midi-Tower
  * HDD: Samsung 830 256GB SSD and some leftover 3TB drive
  * RAM: GEIL EVO Leggera DDR3-1866 CL10 64GB
  * Video: Point of View GTX 680 EXO 4GB
  * Wifi: ASUS PCE-N53 N600

On paper, this should be a rocking system. Fingers crossed.
