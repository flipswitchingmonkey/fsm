Just a quick link to a pretty nice Windows console replacement called [cmder](http://bliker.github.io/cmder/), based on ConEmu but with some further enhancement, notably the Monokai theme as default which is always a plus and some unix tools from git built in.

It&#8217;s also fully portable via USB stick etc.
