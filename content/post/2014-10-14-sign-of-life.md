While there&#8217;s clearly not a whole lot going on in terms of posts, at least the website has in the meanwhile changed hosts three times now ;)   
It&#8217;s now running on [Uberspace](http://uberspace.de) and of all the hosters so far, this one is the most convenient, best set up and most deserving of my money so far ðŸ˜‰

Very nice documentation with straight forward examples, an up to date nodejs implementation, fair pricing (more than fair, really)&#8230; go have a look.

Anyway&#8230; once more I promise (more to myself than to anyone reading, (mostly because there is probably nobody left at this point)) that I will now post stuff more than once a year.

We&#8217;ll see.
