Since I just set up a fresh system, and did the same for OSX, these are some tools I can&#8217;t live without under Windows&#8230;

  * [Sublime Text 2][1] – Hands down the best editor there is. And it&#8217;s multi platform. Just perfect.
  * [Double Commander][2] – a [Total Commander][3] clone
  * [Sysinternals Suite][4] – a collection of excellent tools, formerly Sysinternals, now belonging to Microsoft. Process Explorer replaces the Task Manager for me, ProcMon is excellent for troubleshooting&#8230; really, I can&#8217;t pick one that I like most. They&#8217;re all useful and you should get the entire suite.
  * [Virtual Clonedrive][5] – ISO/IMG mounter
  * [clcl][6] – Clipboard Manager, lightweight, fast
  * [Skylight][7] – a Launcher similar to OSX Spotlight etc.
  * [SuperPuTTY][8] – a nice tabbed PuTTY wrapper for your SSH connections
  * [JefeCheck][9] – a professional image sequence player that recently went free
  * [djv][10] – another image sequence player
  * [Fences][11] – groups icons and folder into groups on the desktop. Very useful, unfortunately not free any more, but well worth the 9.99$ imho.
  * [PeaZip][12] – archiver/unarchiver similar to WinRar
  * [Rapid Environment Editor][13] – great to change environment variables quickly, much more convenient than going through cmd or system settings.
  * [MediaPlayer Classic][14] – some swear on VideoLAN, I prefer mpc
  * [FastStone Image View][15] – again, many like IrfanView, but I prefer FastStone as my image viewer
  * [Visual Studio Express][16] – think of Microsoft what you like, but Visual Studio is a damn decent IDE, and the Express versions are free.
  * [Processing][17] – my creative coding framework of choice
  * [OpenHardwareMonitor][18] – being the mean little overclocker that I am, I have to keep an eye on the temps and fans. This does that.
