Since there has been some confusion as to what the hell the name of the blog means and what is the 
deal with monkeys and switches anyway, here&#8217;s where it all comes from (skip to second 26):

While a mediocre film otherwise, I somehow found Matt LeBlanc&#8217;s line here 
absolutely hilarious. Maybe I&#8217;m just simple.

Basically what it boils down to (yes, I&#8217;m explaining the joke now) is: you&#8217;re getting trained for years in all kinds of ways to blow shit up and then they put you in front of a console where, literally, your only job is to flip a switch.

This, btw., should ring familiar to anyone who studied computer science (or, actually, **anything at all**) and ended up in customer support.
