So, after a moment of worry, I managed to cram everything into the anidees AI-6B case. Since nowhere does it say that SSI-CEB form factor boards actually fit into this case (it is rated for ATX only), I though it might interest some that in fact you \_can\_ use this case together with the Asus&nbsp;W9X79WS &#8211; albeit with a small caveat. Since the CEB sized boards are slightly wider than ATX boards, the rubber openings in the mainboard tray (for cables and such) are mostly covered by the board, so you can&#8217;t use those any more (only for very small cables). However, the fan power distributor thingy that comes with the AI-6B still fits (though I&#8217;m not using it at all).

The biggest pain in this build, as always, was mounting the CPU cooler. While in theory the noctua mounting system is great, here I had to put way too much force in, so that in the end one side of the heatpipes was slightly bent... still appears to be working fine though.

Another, bigger issue, and it really is a big one literally, is the size of the Noctua cooler. It overlaps ever so slightly into the PCI-E slots, so I could not use my GTX-480 in the first PCIE 16x slot, since it had a small plastik cover on the back that got in the coolers way (and vice versa). Keep that in mind if you plan to run SLI!
