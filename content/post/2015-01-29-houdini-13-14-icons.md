As great as certain applications are &#8211; there is often one little thing that really gets on my nerves and could be avoided so easily: same icons. Yes, if you only ever use the latest version of a software, this really does not matter a whole lot. But Sidefx (to their credit!) release a lot of daily builds, and like with e.g. Cinema 4D as well, you often need to use multiple versions of the software at the same time, be it for the reliance on certain plugins only available for that version, or because you were exploiting a bug only existing in that one build. Anyway, you end up with a bunch of identical icons in your taskbar and more often than not, you&#8217;re opening the wrong version by accident.

Why am I even explaining this? I hope someone takes this to heart and incorporates versioned icons in their build process&#8230;

Until then, I&#8217;ve made my own icons and maybe some of you out there can find some use for them as well. Here you go.
