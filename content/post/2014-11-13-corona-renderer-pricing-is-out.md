For a while now I have been playing with the [Corona renderer](https://corona-renderer.com) (since the Alpha for Cinema 4D came out) and I got to say, I was really impressed by the results and the speed. Honestly, just the fact that it immediately starts rendering without lengthy preparations is a big plus&#8230;

First of all, yes, the following is quite obviously not great art&#8230; but it&#8217;s a good test for the speed of a renderer, with refractions, reflections, normal map etc. turned on. The render below was something like 5 minutes (but it was pretty much done even earlier). I know it doesn&#8217;t look like much, but getting these clean refractions, shadows etc. is actually a big deal. And what was even more important: these are almost all just default settings, no lengthy fiddling with lights or materials.

But I digress. What was [accouncend was the pricing for the 3DS Max version of Corona](https://corona-renderer.com/blog/prices-release-date/), which uses the exact same render core but is much more advanced in terms of the plugin itself. Which is why it is time to charge for it I guess. There have also been a number of [adjustments to the pricing](https://corona-renderer.com/blog/discussion-about-prices-licence-politics-ii/) already, which I take as a good sign of the developer listening to the customers.

At first, after having gotten used to using Corona for free, the price &#8211; which is pretty much in line with most other renderers &#8211; came a bit as a shock. But looking at it again, it is actually very fair. Especially the monthly licences, which can be booked as required per month, are quite fair, coming with 3-10 render nodes as well. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;boxed &#8220;version which is a regular licence which needs a 99 Euro upgrade subscription per year. Technically, after a few years, you are probably better off with that one, \_if\_ you decide to subscribe the SaaS version continuosly &#8211; but the whole point is that you probably won&#8217;t. Instead I&#8217;m thinking we&#8217;ll go for a mixed approach &#8211; get one or two boxed versions and ramp up the number of licences only during projects that require it. Or maybe go SaaS entirely &#8211; from a tax perspective this can be attractive because it means you can deduct those costs immediately and don&#8217;t have to spread it out over years.

In any case, of all the CPU renderers out there for Cinema 4D, Corona right now is the one that feels like the most promising!

Even the motion blur feels super fast (very similar to Octane actually).
