A new version of Dokuwiki has been released and it now finally comes with a nice default template, namely the one they are using for the dokuwiki site itself. For the upgrade, I recommend the upgrade plugin, which makes things much easier than having to go through the whole unpacking and overwriting manually. Just remember to backup your folder beforehand.

Dokuwiki has been my wiki of choice for a while now. It&#8217;s document based rather than using a database to store its articles, which makes it super easy to move and install on virtually anything that runs PHP. I&#8217;m not sure how well it scales, tbh., but for you team-wiki or general small user base wiki, it&#8217;s a very decent option.
