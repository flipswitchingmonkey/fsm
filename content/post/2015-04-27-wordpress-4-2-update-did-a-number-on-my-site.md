Well then&#8230; this was fun. Updated to 4.2 and everything fell apart. The wheels came off. Fire in the attic. So, currently the theme is semi-fucked up and Gust isn&#8217;t working either&#8230; That&#8217;s all. Update: mostly working again now.

Update: ArÅ«nas Liuiza has released [Gust 0.4.1](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gust/) which fixes the issues with WP 4.2.
